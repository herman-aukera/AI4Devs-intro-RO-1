# Prompt Used

You are a developer assistant. I'm working on a frontend coding challenge for the AI4Devs bootcamp.

🎯 Your task: Generate a full project folder containing:

1. A file `index.html`:
   - With an input field to type a string.
   - Linked to an external `script.js`.
   - Includes a `<div>` to show the reversed string.
   - A “Reverse” button that only appears when the input has more than 3 characters.

2. A file `script.js`:
   - JavaScript logic to reverse the string and display the result in real time.
   - Show/hide the button based on input length.

3. A file `prompts.md`:
   - Include this exact prompt used to generate the project.

4. A file `README.md`:
   - Brief explanation of what the project does.
   - Technologies used.
   - Instructions to test it locally.
   - State that it took 1 hour to complete.
   - Mention best practices (e.g. external scripts, prompt documentation).
   - Include `#FollowtheLIDR`.

5. A `.gitignore` file:
   - Add `.idea/` to exclude JetBrains IDE config.

🧪 Output:
- Return the full contents of all files clearly separated with filenames.
- Make them ready for copy-paste into a new folder structure.
- Explain step-by-step how to set it up locally and test it in a browser.
